# Nigeria-Post-Harvest-Loss-Analysis
This analysis examines the key factors that contribute to post-harvest loss (PHL) and revenue loss
in the agricultural value chain. Using Excel-based dashboards and PivotTable-driven metrics, we
discuss how storage methods, transport type, market access, weather conditions, and capacity-building efforts affect spoilage and profitability. The goal is to provide actionable insights to
reduce losses and improve outcomes for smallholder farmers and stakeholders in the agricultural
sector.
